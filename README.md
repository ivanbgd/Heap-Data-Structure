# Heap-Data-Structure
The Heap data structure, in Python and C++

Heaps are Complete Binary Trees.

The Complete Binary Max-Heap is implemented as an array, which is both fast and memory efficient. It's also easy to code.

There are two variants of heaps here: the one that uses 1-based indexing, and the other that uses 0-based indexing, into arrays.

Priority Queues are usually implemented as Heaps.

The code includes examples.
